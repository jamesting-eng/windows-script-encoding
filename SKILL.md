  Windows script (.ps1/.bat/.cmd) encoding & line-ending iron rules to stop
  PowerShell parse-stage failures from recurring. Write scripts with CRLF + pure
  ASCII via Python, self-check before running, and prefer inline PowerShell over
  writing script files.

# windows-script-encoding — Windows Script Encoding Iron Rules

## One-liner
**Any `.ps1` / `.bat` / `.cmd` that must run on Windows must be written with CRLF + pure ASCII, then self-checked with Python immediately — otherwise it will fail over and over.**

## Trigger symptoms (the "I've hit this in multiple project chats" kind)
- A PowerShell script fails with **"syntax error at parse stage"** on the user's machine, but the tool shows **no error message at all** — only exit 1
- The same PowerShell code needs its "format" tweaked several times before it runs — usually an LF ↔ CRLF flip-flop
- Historical lesson: Chinese comments inside `.bat` / `.cmd` → GBK mojibake → WSH accidentally executes `.js` → error `800A03EA` (already in long-term memory, write pure ASCII). `.ps1` is a new pit with similar symptoms but a different root cause

## Root cause (empirically confirmed 2026-09-06)

1. **Line endings**: Windows PowerShell 5.1 fails at the **parse stage on LF-only `.ps1` files** — not a logic error, not an encoding error, just a parse failure.
   - Proof: the same `.ps1` changed from LF-only to CRLF went from "exit 1 + no message" to running immediately. The local `fix_db_isolation_v3.ps1` is LF but stable in production; PS actually accepts both, but **new scripts should standardize on CRLF** (verified by comparison).
   - The user's production scripts (`watchdog.bat` / `pull.bat` / `push.bat`) are uniformly **CRLF + pure ASCII**.

2. **Error swallowing**: the local PowerShell tool **swallows all of the script's stdout/stderr**, returning only exit 1. So you think it's a logic bug, but it's the LF line ending — and you never get to see the real error. **This is the root reason the problem keeps recurring unnoticed.**

3. **Historical lesson**: `.bat` / `.cmd` must not contain Chinese comments (GBK mojibake → WSH → 800A03EA). `.ps1` seems to "tolerate Chinese comments", but the **line-ending** pit will still bite repeatedly if unaddressed.

## Iron rules (must follow)

### Write spec
- **`.ps1` / `.bat` / `.cmd` always CRLF + pure ASCII**. Change Chinese comments to English or delete them.
- Write via explicit binary write, forcing CRLF:
  ```python
  # The only safe way to write .ps1/.bat/.cmd
  content = '...'.encode('ascii')            # 1) force ASCII check
  content = content.replace(b'\n', b'\r\n')  # 2) force CRLF
  open(path, 'wb').write(content)
  ```
- **Do NOT** write `.ps1`/`.bat`/`.cmd` directly with the Edit/Write tools (they default to LF and may add a UTF-8 BOM) — that is the source of repeated failures.

### Self-check immediately after writing (non-skippable)
```python
raw = open(path, 'rb').read()
assert b'\r\n' in raw, 'CRLF MISSING — will fail'
assert raw.count(b'\n') - raw.count(b'\r\n') == 0, 'LF-only lines detected — will fail'
assert all(b < 128 for b in raw), 'non-ASCII bytes detected — will fail'
```

### Prefer inline PowerShell over writing a .ps1 file
- One-liners: run directly via the PowerShell tool with `-Command "..."`
- Must write `.ps1`: write + self-check per above, then invoke
- No stdout: `script.ps1 *>&1 | Out-File -FilePath $env:TEMP\out.txt`, then `Read` that file
- **Fallback**: if it just won't run, switch to Python via the Bash channel (most reliable, Bash tool output is visible)

## Standard workflow
1. **Avoid writing a script if possible** — if a one-line PowerShell command via the tool works, use that
2. **Must write `.ps1` / `.bat` / `.cmd`**: Python binary write + force CRLF + pure ASCII
3. **Self-check immediately**: CRLF > 0, LF-only lines = 0, non-ASCII = 0 (any fail → rewrite, don't debug logic)
4. **Run a hello-world probe**: first `Write-Output "test"` to verify the script can output, then run real logic
5. **Problem + no message**: 100% line-ending or encoding — rewrite per spec, **don't doubt the logic**
6. **Cross-project**: scan every `.bat`/`.cmd`/`.ps1` against this checklist before delivery

## Anti-patterns (hard-won lessons)
- ❌ Write `.ps1` with Edit/Write tools then run directly — 90% exit 1 with no message
- ❌ Chinese comments in `.bat` — GBK mojibake + WSH mis-execution + 800A03EA
- ❌ LF line endings in `.ps1` — Windows PowerShell 5.1 parse failure
- ❌ See exit 1 and start fixing logic — 99% it's line-ending or encoding, logic is usually fine
- ❌ Chinese strings in PowerShell log output — even if it runs, it's a time bomb on another machine
- ❌ Tweak the format a few times, "looks like it runs, ship it" — untested scripts are time bombs, they'll fail again

## Emergency fallback
- **No output**: `*>&1 | Out-File -FilePath $env:TEMP\out.txt`, then `Read` out.txt
- **Won't run at all**: switch to Python via Bash channel (most reliable)
- **Suspect execution policy**: add `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in the PowerShell tool
- **Still suspect environment**: run via Python `subprocess.run(['powershell','-File',path], capture_output=True)` yourself (Bash→pwsh is intercepted locally; use the PowerShell tool itself)

## Related iron rules (already in cross-project memory)
- User-level `~/.workbuddy/MEMORY.md` "Runtime environment pit": `sitecustomize` hijacks `os.unlink` → Python file deletion must use `-S` to bypass
- User-level `~/.workbuddy/MEMORY.md` dual-language iron rule v2.1: scripts are never translated (`.bat` pure ASCII, 0 non-ASCII bytes)
- Project-level `cross-device-sync` deploy red lines: `.bat`/`.cmd` pure ASCII + delete files via Python
